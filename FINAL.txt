					AIT Computer Vision
					Final Project: Freeze Frame
					Alan, Julia

====== v.1 ======
- obtain input video
- process first frame & 'cut out' 4 markers. save as .jpg
- give 4 jpg as input to function (open as R2Image s)
- find 4 markers on each frame (maintain last coordinates for better local searching)
       - option: high pass to high pass compare
       - what we're going to do: just SSD it
- for now, draw a lil square around marker




===(a future version)===
(1)  *New Function*
first frame processing
      - In: R2Image
      - Out: vector of 8 points. Each marker (4) defined by 2 points
      
      - find 4 markers
      

(2) feature tracking
locate 4 markers on every frame
based on previous location (local search)
